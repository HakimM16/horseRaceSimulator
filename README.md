## 🎮 Usage Guidelines for Part 1
![start](photos/Screenshot%202025-07-29%20120723.png) <br>
🎬 **Launch the application on the terminal. After, a prompt will come to ask you to enter the length the race should be.**

![enter horses](photos/Screenshot%202025-07-29%20120824.png) <br>
🐎 **Enter the names of the 3 horses.**

![confidence](photos/Screenshot%202025-07-29%20120849.png)<br>
💪 **Enter the confidence levels of each horse.**

![n](photos/Screenshot%202025-07-29%20120901.png)<br>
♟️ **This question asks if you want to enter custom symbols. If not, the program will use 
the default symbols: ♘, ♚, ♖**

![pre](photos/Screenshot%202025-07-29%20120916.png) <br>
📄 **This is where the horses' confidence levels and symbols will show. Then, it asks which horse will win.**

![start of race](photos/Screenshot%202025-07-29%20121002.png) <br>
**🏇 This is the race track. The horses are lined up in 3 horses and at the other side of the race track, the horses' confidence levels are displayed.**

**There can be different results of the race such as the chosen horse winning the race or all horse fell.**

![fell](photos/Screenshot%202025-07-29%20121017.png)<br>

**For example, all of the horses in the race have fell and returns a message saying all horses have fallen.**

![other](photos/Screenshot%202025-07-29%20121132.png)<br>
**Another example is that one of the horses have won but it wasn't the horse guessed so it returns a message about the winner of the race and the user is wrong about his prediction.**


## 🎮 Usage Guidelines for Part 2

🎬 **After launching the application, a window will pop up. This allows you to enter the number of lanes you want, the length of the track, the track shape, and the weather conditions.**

![f](photos/Screenshot%202025-07-29%20120023.png)<br>
🐎 **Upon submission, a window will appear that provides an interface for customizing one of the horses. You will have options to select the breed, symbol, coat color, saddle, horseshoes, and accessories. Each of these choices will affect the horse's attributes, including speed, stamina, and confidence.**

![d](photos/Screenshot%202025-07-29%20120110.png)<br>
**Upon submission, a message will confirm the horse's successful save and display its qualities.**

![k](photos/Screenshot%202025-07-29%20120224.png)<br>
💵 **After you submit the last horse, a window labeled "Betting System" will appear. This window will display all the horses along with their odds. There will be two input boxes where you can enter the horse you believe will win and the amount you wish to bet.**

![o](photos/Screenshot%202025-07-29%20120236.png)<br>
**After submitting, a pop-up window will show the horse's name, bet amount, betting odds, and potential winnings.**

![t](photos/Screenshot%202025-07-29%20120247.png)<br>
🛤️ **This window represents the race and shows the type of race track you have selected in the 'Select Race' window, such as an oval track. It also includes a section called "Horse Statistics," which displays all the horses participating in the race, along with their symbols, average speed, stamina, confidence, and odds. In addition, the title of the window is the selected type of the track and the weather that was chosen. Finally, there are two buttons that allow you to start the race or reset it after the race is done.**

![s](photos/Screenshot%202025-07-29%20120255.png)<br>
🏇 **After you press the start button, the horse will begin racing around the track until it either crosses the finish line or falls (indicated by an X). At the same time, a timer will start. The timer will stop when all the horses have either fallen or one horse has crossed the finish line.**

![r](photos/Screenshot%202025-07-29%20120307.png)<br>
🥇 **Once all the horses have either fallen or one horse has crossed the finish line, a pop-up window will appear displaying the winner. If the horse you guessed is the winner, the message will inform you that you have won the potential earnings. If not, it will show you how much you have lost.**

![statistics](photos/Screenshot%202025-07-29%20120347.png)<br>
📊 **After placing your bet, a page titled "Statistics" will appear. This page will show the horse you wagered on along with the bet amount. It will also display the winning horse and the time it took to complete the race. Additionally, all participating horses and their attributes will be listed, with the winning horse highlighted in bold red font. Finally, there will be a button labeled "View History," which allows you to see all previous races from the current program run.**

![history](photos/Screenshot%202025-07-29%20120404.png)<br>
📜 **After pressing the history button, a window will open displaying all the horse races from the program. Each race is listed on a separate line with the following details: betting horse, weather conditions during the race, winner, time taken, betting odds, betting amount, bet result, and money won or lost.**
